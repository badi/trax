* Description

  A transactional log consists of two components:
  1. a checkpoint
  2. an incremental log

  The premise is as follows. The main program may periodically save its state via checkpointing.
  However, if the time between checkpoints is large (hours or greater), a lot of work may need to be recompute
  in order to recover. The incremental log solves this problem by logging values between checkpoints.
  This way, if the program needs to recover, it can load the previous state from the checkpoint and then "fast-forward"
  by replaying the log.
  After each checkpoint, the log is flushed as it's state has been saved.
