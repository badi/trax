* Description

  A transactional log consists of two components:
  1. a checkpoint
  2. an incremental log

  The premise is as follows. The main program may periodically save its state via checkpointing.
  However, if the time between checkpoints is large (hours or greater), a lot of work may need to be recomputed
  in order to recover. The incremental log solves this problem by logging values between checkpoints.
  This way, if the program needs to recover, it can load the previous state from the checkpoint and then "fast-forward"
  by replaying the log.
  After each checkpoint, the log is cleared as its state has been saved.


* Basic Usage
  The API provides three main methods: *checkpoint*, *log*, and *recover*.
  Semantics are as follows:
    - Each call to *checkpoint* saves the current state and clears the log file
    - A call to *log* saves the value to the log file
    - *recover* operates by accepting two callback functions, each operation a file descriptor.
	    - The *checkpoint_handler* accepts a file descriptor to the checkpoint file and returns the state with is passed to *log_handler*.
	    - *log_handler* accepts the state and a file descriptor to the log file and is responsible for replaying the log.

  The *trax.SimpleTransactional* class should cover most usage
  requirements. It operates by using /cPickle/ (if it is not
  available then /pickle/ is used) to *checkpoint*, but the user is
  responsible for providing the *log_handler* callback.

  A basic usage pattern is as follows:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import trax
import cPickle as pickle

logger = trax.SimpleTransactional()
mystate = logger.recover(lambda mystate, value: mystate.update(value))

value = expensive_compute_function()
mystate.update(value)
trx.log(value)
if time % frequency == 0:
    trx.checkpoint(mystate)
#+END_SRC

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ python setup.py install --prefix $PREFIX
#+END_SRC

Make sure to update the =$PYHTONPATH= environmental variable to include =$PREFIX/lib/python$PYVERSION/site-packages=
